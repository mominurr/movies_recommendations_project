# Movie Recommendation Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a movie recommendation system using Python. The system analyzes movie data, including user ratings, and generates personalized movie recommendations for users. It's a basic implementation for educational purposes.

## Dataset

- `movies.csv`: Contains information about movies, including movie ID, title, and genres.
- `ratings.csv`: Contains user ratings for movies, including user ID, movie ID, rating, and timestamp.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing involves:
- Loading the movie and ratings data from the CSV files.
- Cleaning and handling missing values if necessary using pandas.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following Python library:
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Used for data manipulation and cleaning.

## Usage
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install pandas`.
3. Run the Python script for movie recommendations.
